Here’s a clean context.txt you can directly paste into your project overview.
No fluff. Clear logic. Structured. This is what evaluators and devs understand.

Project Context – University-Only Live Conversation Platform

This project is a university-exclusive, consent-driven social interaction platform designed for students to meet, chat, and optionally connect outside the platform in a safe and structured way.

The platform is not a traditional dating app. Instead, it focuses on guided, real-time conversations with clear stages and mutual consent at every step.

⸻

Authentication & Access Control
	•	Only users with a verified university email ID can register.
	•	Email-based OTP verification ensures authenticity.
	•	One account per university email.
	•	Users must be 18+ to participate.

This guarantees a closed, trusted campus-only ecosystem.

⸻

User Profile Structure

Each user completes a minimal profile containing:
	•	Name or nickname
	•	Course
	•	Department
	•	Academic year
	•	Gender
	•	Optional short bio

No personal contact details are visible during chat stages.

⸻

Live Conversation Model
	•	The platform uses real-time socket-based communication.
	•	No chat history is stored (no chat stories).
	•	Conversations exist only during the live session.
	•	Once a chat ends, messages are permanently discarded.

This design prioritizes privacy and reduces misuse.

⸻

Stage-Based Conversation Flow

Each conversation progresses through controlled stages managed by the backend as a state machine.

Stage 0 – Match Initiated
	•	Two users are matched.
	•	Live chat is enabled.
	•	No personal data shared.

Stage 1 – Icebreaker Phase
	•	Users begin casual conversation.
	•	Optional system prompts may appear to reduce awkwardness.
	•	Triggered after a minimum message or time threshold.

Stage 2 – Private Interest Check
	•	Each user is privately asked:
“Are you enjoying this conversation?”
	•	Responses are hidden from the other user.
	•	If both respond “Yes”, the chat continues.
	•	If either responds “No”, the chat ends gracefully.

Stage 3 – Mutual Engagement Phase
	•	Deeper conversation is unlocked.
	•	Additional reflection prompts may appear.
	•	No notifications reveal individual decisions.

Stage 4 – Connection Decision
	•	Users are privately asked:
“Do you want to connect outside this platform?”
	•	Options: Yes / Not Now / No
	•	Only a Yes + Yes outcome unlocks the next stage.

Stage 5 – Contact Exchange & Exit
	•	WhatsApp numbers are shared simultaneously.
	•	In-app chat is locked after exchange.
	•	The session ends permanently.

⸻

Consent & Safety Principles
	•	No personal contact is shared without explicit mutual consent.
	•	Rejection is silent and private.
	•	Users can block or report at any time.
	•	Ending a chat immediately terminates the session on both sides.

⸻

System Philosophy
	•	Real-time, ephemeral communication
	•	Privacy-first architecture
	•	Mutual consent over algorithms
	•	Clean entry and clean exit for every interaction

⸻

End Outcome

The platform’s responsibility ends once both users mutually agree to connect outside the system.
No long-term data retention, no forced engagement, and no pressure-driven interactions.

If you want next:
	•	I can convert this into SRS format
	•	Or give you backend state-machine logic
	•	Or write socket event flow (JOIN_CHAT, INTEREST_CHECK, END_CHAT)

You’re building this the right way.
